## Overview
The project was developed as part of the EECS 6414 - Data Analytics and Visualization course at York University. The primary tools used for the analysis include Python for data processing and Tableau for data visualization.

## Key Features
Time Series Analysis: Examination of robbery trends over the years to detect any significant changes or correlations with city demographics or economic events.
Seasonality Patterns: Identification of seasonal patterns in robbery incidents to aid law enforcement agencies in resource allocation.
Spatial Analysis: Visualization of robbery hotspots across Toronto to assist in targeting high-risk areas.
Premises Analysis: Analysis of the types of locations most frequently targeted by robbers.

## Methodology
The analysis involved several steps:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Initial exploration to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.
Visualization: Creation of histograms, scatter plots, and heat maps to uncover patterns and relationships.
Statistical Analysis: Application of statistical methods, including k-means clustering, to identify outliers and ensure robustness.
Findings
The analysis revealed key insights into the temporal and spatial distribution of robbery incidents in Toronto, helping inform strategies for crime prevention and resource allocation by law enforcement agencies.

## Future Work
Potential extensions of this analysis include:

Robbery-Income Relationship: Correlating crime rates with neighborhood income data.
Comparative Analysis: Comparing robbery incidents across different cities in Canada or globally.
Community Policing Impact: Analyzing the effectiveness of community policing measures like security cameras on robbery incidents.
